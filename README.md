# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

### Installation
first install all the necessary packages
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
To run the app on developer mode, use:
  ```sh
  `npm start -g
  ```
Open the app in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
